          <article class="center">
            <p>I was born, raised, and currently live in Northern California. I’ve been involved in a lot of different things professionally. While I love to solve problems in a technical sense, my passions are creative in nature.</p>

           <p>After graduating high-school at the young age of sixteen, I went on to college for both Opticianry and music. Two very different worlds, but one was a job and the other a passion.</p>

           <p>My aim was to find something to combine a job and my passion. Thus I began pursuing Graphic Design and now Software Development as a student at <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>. So far I love it. I’m really looking forward to the many projects ahead.</p>

            <p>I’d love to work with you!</p>
